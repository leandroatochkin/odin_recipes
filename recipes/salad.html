        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This is my mother's recipe for authentic German potato salad. Everyone, German or not, loves it. It is easy to double the recipe as well. I often bring it to potlucks, and we also have it at home on special occasions. There are usually no leftovers, but if there are, they don't last long!</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Potatoes: We recommend using waxy potatoes (such as New Potatoes) because they hold their shape well. Yukon Gold, an all-purpose variety, is also a good choice.</li> 
            <li>Bacon: Bacon (and its grease) adds tons of meaty flavor to the hearty German potato salad. </li>
            <li>Onion: An onion, cooked in bacon grease, lends even more complexity and flavor. </li>
            <li>Vinegar: White vinegar adds tanginess that cuts through the richness from the potatoes and bacon. </li>
            <li>Sugar: A bit of white sugar gives the savory potato salad subtle sweetness. </li>
            <li>Seasonings and herbs: This German potato salad recipe is seasoned with salt, pepper, and fresh parsley. </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Boil, drain, and cool the diced and peeled potatoes. </li>
            <li>Fry the bacon in a skillet, then cook the onion in the bacon grease. </li>
            <li>Add the vinegar, sugar, water, salt, and pepper and bring to a boil. </li>
            <li>Add the potatoes and Â½ of the bacon to the boiling liquid. </li>
            <li>When heated through, transfer the potatoes to a serving dish.</li> 
            <li>Garnish with remaining bacon and parsley. </li>
        </ol>
